# stargazing

Nifty little script to help the astronomer in your family keep "their eyes" in the dark. It relies on a utility called xcalib, a "tiny monitor calibration loader for X.org."
The xcalib application works only with X11, so it is not functional on Wayland systems. 

### Dependencies
* xcalib
* bash

### Install
* Download the script: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victorhck/stargazing/master/stargazing
* Execution permissions: chmod +x stargazing
* Run the following commando to run the script and see the options available: ./stargazing *
